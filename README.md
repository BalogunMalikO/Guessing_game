# Guessing_game
Guessing game is a game built with the intention to kill boredome. 

# How it works?
Users are prompted to guess a number and input the number. The game then checks if the number is the same number as the game generated number, if it is, the game prints a congratulatory message to the user else, if the number is too big or too small, the game prints either too big or too small

# Problems Encountered
While recreating the game, i had hard time understanding the following:

<li> MATCH in rust

<li> REFRENCING in rust

# How i solved the problems

<li> MATCHING : I visited chapter 6 of the official where i learned matching, i was able to deduce that matching in rust is similar to if...else statement and from that point, i was able to comprehend.

<li> Refrencing: I simply interpreted the word. 

# Thank you for reading
